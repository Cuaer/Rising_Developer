# Rising_Developer
An updated portfolio to the work achieved in my coding boot camp as well as links to my LinkedIn profile and updated resume.

As a growing developer, it is vital to be employer-competitive; to stand out and demonstrate one's work to attract the eye of a potential employee.

Some requirements include: 
1. Displaying contact information.

2. Links to one's GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile.

3. Link to a downloadable PDF of one's resume.

4. Display at least 2 examples of one's work from either deployed projects or homeworks which include the following:

    * Project title

    * Link to the deployed version

    * Link to the GitHub repository

    * Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.
